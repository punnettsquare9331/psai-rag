PX221601_Scoliosis_BendTest_AdamsTest_Deformities,"This is a screening test to determine if an individual has scoliosis or signs of scoliosis. While bending forward the individual has their feet together, knees straight, and their arms dangling by their sides. If signs of scoliosis are observed, an x-ray with Cobb technique is recommended. Signs of scoliosis include imbalances in the rib cage (i.e., one side is higher than the other), and other deformities along the back.",DCW_221601.doc,enumerated,,,,,"If signs of scoliosis are observed, an x-ray with Cobb technique is recommended.

PX221601_Scoliosis_BendTest_CobbTechnique,"Identify the superior and the inferior end vertebrae—the vertebrae with the greatest tilt at the proximal and distal ends of the curve. The angle between them is measured by drawing a line from the top of the superior end vertebra parallel to the upper endplate, and another line from the bottom of the inferior end vertebra parallel to the lower endplate. Perpendicular lines are then constructed at right angles to the lines along the endplates. The angle formed by the intersection of the perpendicular lines defines the Cobb angle. This angle is then compared to a standard scale in order to determine whether or not the curvature is potentially harmful. Individuals with a straight spine have zero degree curve.",DCW_221601.doc,enumerated,deg,0º,,,Individuals with a curve between 0o and 10o degrees are considered to have a curvature. Individuals with a spine that has a curve of greater than 10o degrees are considered to have scoliosis. Typically surgery is recommended in adolescents with a curve of a Cobb angle of more than 45o to 50o degrees.,,PhenX,PX221601030000,,,,,0º,0º and 10º,10º -45º,>45º,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
